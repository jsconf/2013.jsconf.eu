description: "In the early 20th century Hollywood invented a new visual language, and the way we think about and understand stories was changed forever. Today, a similar shift is happening - stories are becoming non-linear, rich in media and crossing over into the real world. From transmedia theatre to games and interactive narratives, the way we tell stories is changing, and JavaScript is emerging as an essential tool for storytellers.\n\nI will talk about how JavaScript is increasing the possibilities of interactive storytelling and media art experiences, such as enabling the manipulation of sound with libraries such as Buzz, and delivering transmedia narrative through mobile devices using PhoneGap and HTML5. You'll learn about how others are using JavaScript to re-imagine what a story an be and how it can be told, and how you can use it too."
