description: "In 1993 we build successful applications like email servers and clients - successful because they were build on open protocols. In 2003 we built great web servers - successful for being distributed and runnable by anyone. In 2013 we build applications against APIs that came usage limits and that would shut you down if you were in the wrong \"quadrant\". Where did we go so wrong?"
