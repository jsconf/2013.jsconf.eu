description: "The 80s spawned a plethora of novel yet elegant programming tools, with environments such as Smalltalk, Oberon, Self and Boxer arguably being well ahead of their time. Several of such tools were dubbed \"microworlds\", sandboxed canvases in which users' computational creations could be sculpted, evolved and mashed together with ease. With the availability of modern systems and browser technology, perhaps their time has finally come.\n\nUsing a hybrid visual programming environment, I will demonstrate how the humble web browser can be used to create ad-hoc, reusable environments suitable for a variety of tasks across various disciplines."
