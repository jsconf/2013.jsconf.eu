description: "Refreshing your Twitter feed is such a drag over 3G, taking forever to connect and fetch those precious kilobytes.  The reasons for this go deep into the architecture of the internet: making an HTTPS connection simply has terrible latency.\n\nSo let's fix the internet!  MinimaLT is an exciting new network protocol that connects faster than TCP, is more secure than TLS (crypto by DJ Bernstein), and allows mobile devices to keep connections open as they change IP addresses.  This talk presents the MinimaLT protocol and a Node library that allows JS hackers to experimentally build a new Internet."
