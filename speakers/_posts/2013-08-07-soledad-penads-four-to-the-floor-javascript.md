description: "In the era of information overload, simple slides just don't cut it.\n\nBrace yourselves, for you're going to experience a never-seen-before JavaScript talk. Or rather, a meta-talk: a continuous, seamless display of rich media content where I'll describe how you can build this kind of engaging, hypnotic talks that involve the speaker, audio, visuals and a good dose of beats. All it takes is a little bit of rhythm."
