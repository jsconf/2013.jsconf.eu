description: "In this talk we will look at the difference in how two-way bindings are implemented and used in three popular JS frameworks: AngularJS, EmberJS and KnockoutJS. We will see how they are used, how they can be extended and how the three frameworks implement the binding with the HTML. We will explore what the implementation means for performance and ease of use. \n\nThis is not a talk about which framework is best, or which one you should use in your projects. The focus is on the strengths and weaknesses of the different implementations and finding out what the different frameworks have in common and what they can learn from each other. "
