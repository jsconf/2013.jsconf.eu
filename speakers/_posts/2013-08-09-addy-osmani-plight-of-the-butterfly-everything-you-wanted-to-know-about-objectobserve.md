description: "Some people say that when a butterfly lands on you it means good luck. However, in parts of England, people would traditionally rush around to kill the first butterfly of the year that they see, or else face a year of bad luck. The moral of the story is that people can be crazy. \n\nThey can also surprise you, a lot like Object.observe() - a proposed feature for listening to any JavaScript object that gets called whenever that object, or its properties, change - surprised me. In this session, I'll walk you through everything I thought I knew about Object.observe() but didn't, while profiling it for V8 this year."
