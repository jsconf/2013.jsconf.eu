description: "One of Silicon Valley’s most accomplished internet veterans, Marc Andreessen, declared software as a driving factor of innovation and economic growth with the famous statement: “In short, software’s eating the world”.\n\nAs software quickly innovates, we witness a growing shift in the way humans interact with software applications. The most obvious trend is the shift from consumer and enterprise grade desktop applications to the mobile/smartphone platform.\n\nMy talk will outline a comprehensive approach for tackling the key challenges attached to the delivering smartphone users with a reliable and continuously tested mobile experience. My toolkit relies on emerging and exciting new open source components (some of which to be announced for the first time at JSConf.eu).\n\nI’m looking forward to taking JSConf EU attendees on a ride into the future of mobile app delivery, to spread some of my excitement around the powerful coordination of emerging open source services and javascript technologies."
