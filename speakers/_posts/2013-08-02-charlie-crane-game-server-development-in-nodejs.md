description: "Node.js is really suitable for realtime network application, and game server is a typical one.  However, game server technology is not as open as other technology, there is almost no open source framework and standard about it. Pomelo framework is a fast, scalable, distributed game server framework for node.js, which we open sourced 6 months ago and gained a lot of attention. We believe it's going to change the whole industry of network game. \nThis topic is about the design of pomelo framework(abstract, scalability, performance etc.), and how to develop game server with it.
