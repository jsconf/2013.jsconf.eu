description: "Users want to use a native mobile UI, and developers want to write JavaScript. I'll be discussing the benefits of using a JavaScript engine in your native app instead of going all-web or all-native. Get the best of both worlds: logic in JavaScript and a slick native UI. We'll also look at how this turns out to be an interesting way to build cross-platform apps that have a damn fast user interface."
