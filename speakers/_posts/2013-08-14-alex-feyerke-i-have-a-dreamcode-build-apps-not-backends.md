description: "The way frontend coders work with data is still very much determined by historical technical necessities and sentiments instead of by how they would _like_ to work. We're proposing a friendlier, more frontend-centered approach to building data-driven applications, where the backend adapts to the frontend developer's dream code. At the end of this lies the wish many frontend devs have: \"I wish I wouldn't have to worry about the backend anymore.\" Well, your time is coming."
