description: "JavaScript was developed as a simple language for adding dynamic effects to one-paged sites. With the emerging complexity of contemporary web applications, non-strictness of JavaScript becomes problematic. The Web development community has created a number of technologies to statically check the correctness of JavaScript code, however, there’s a limit to what those tools can infer from the code, and their efficiency can be greatly improved by adding type annotations to your code, either through JSDoc or by using a language that compiles to JavaScript and supports optional typing.\n\nIn my presentation I’ll give some examples showing which errors can be prevented using these tools. Also I’ll show how a modern JavaScript IDE can improve your coding experience when it has some information about types."
