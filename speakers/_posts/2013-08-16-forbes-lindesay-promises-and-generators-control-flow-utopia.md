description: "I will talk about how ES6 generators can help you make your asynchronous code easier to understand in terms of synchronous concepts. I will discuss the alternative values you can use to represent a future and how they are all ultimately promises.  Finally, I will discuss how you can get some of the same benefits in thought processes by using promises today."
