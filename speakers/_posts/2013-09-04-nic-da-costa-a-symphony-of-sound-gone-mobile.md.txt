description: "With nothing more than a baton, it is considered a conductor's duty to be able to synchronise and shape the sounds of a given ensemble. Last year Stuart Memo rocked the house armed with only a guitar and the Web Audio API when he showed us that JavaScript is the new punk rock.\n\nThis year I hope to show mobile the same love and help create our very own JSConf Orchestra, as we join together as a community and play a symphony of sound. I will talk about working with sound ( both HTML5 Audio and the Web Audio API ) on mobile devices as well as how to synchronise sounds across several devices."
