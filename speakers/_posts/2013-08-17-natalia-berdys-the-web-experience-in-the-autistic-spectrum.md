description: "Designing with cognitively-impaired users in mind can be very illuminative, leading to a broader understanding of the role of UX/UI design in general. The perceptual issues involved for users with Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism in fact pave the way for current web trends - their web experience can be the most sensitive test of good design."
