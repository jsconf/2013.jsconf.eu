description: "Touch screens, physical sensors and hardware miniaturization have\ngreatly enhanced the personal connection between ourselves and our\ndigital devices. Mapping physical input to UI/UX, operating systems\nnow simulate natural systems. We swipe, shake, push and pinch as\nwilling participants in a simulation meant to mirror our physical\nworld.\n\nIn this talk, we'll examine in detail the special qualities of natural\nlooking motion and how a simple combination of forces can lure our\nperception. We'll focus specifically on natural coding in a web\nbrowser and how we can overcome the challenges browsers present.\nFinally, we'll look at how applying a natural coding approach to\nprototyping can expand the creative possibilities of the products we\ncreate on both desktop and mobile platforms."
