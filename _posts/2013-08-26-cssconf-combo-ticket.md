Tickets are completely and irrevocably sold out, but we do have one more chance to get the ultimate conference fix: <a href="https://tito.io/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-2013">The JSConf/CSSconf EU combo ticket!</a>

<p><a href="http://2013.cssconf.eu/">CSSconf.eu</a> is a conference dedicated to the designers, developers and engineers who build the world’s most engaging user interfaces. It happens the day before JSConf and happens to be in Berlin as well :)</p>

Talks at CSSconf include:
- XSS: Cross-site styling
- Maths-powered transforms for creating 3D shapes
- … and "Pooping out CSS"

Among the <a href="http://2013.cssconf.eu/speakers/"> CSSConf speakers</a> are Chris Eppstein, the creator of SASS, Nicole Sullivan and Angelina Fabbro.
