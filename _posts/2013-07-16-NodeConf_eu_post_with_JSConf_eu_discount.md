NódeConf.eu – What’s it all about ?

One of the outstanding attributes that many Irish people share is a great love (‘Grá Mór) for their country. We are great hosts and we take pride in how well we treat our guests, it’s a serious business after all when you live on an island off the cost of mainland Europe. We, the organisers of NódeConf.eu would like to extend a huge welcome to you, the lovely people that are travelling from all over the world to be our guests.

NódeConf.eu is a part of the JS family of events, and to celebrate the week of the 8th September (NódeConf.eu, then JSConf.eu) we would like to send you a limited coupon for a discounted ticket to the conference, we would also like to create a seamless experience for you when you travel from NódeConf to JSConf, se we’re organising an early morning bus for you to get to Dublin airport on the morning of the 12th of September.

So what is the plan for Node Conf? 
Well, following an inspirational conference experience at NodeConf.us this year we have taken a hybrid approach to the NódeConf.eu experience. Firstly we would like to create a relaxed conference experience where attendees will not be subjected to too many talks to take in new information. We would also like to give you plenty of time to build things while you are at the conference, so the format will be to do a small number of “traditional” conference talks each day (6-7 talks in the morning). Then we will be doing some hands-on tutorial style events in the afternoons matching the morning’s talks where you will get to build some of the stuff from the talks in the morning.

We also have an entire Island to ourselves! We have some dedicated hacking spaces where you can hang out and build stuff during the conference including a robot hack-zone where you can build moving things with claws and flashingin lights!

So behind the conference there is a burning desire to show you what a great place Ireland is, for you to experience our culture, heritage and cuisine! 
The conference is being held on the same week as a food festival in the area local to NódeLand, there will be some really nice treats in store for you. There will also be some great musical events and history talks to experience with you while you are here. 

Oh and if you’d like to bring a significant other, we will have a great SO track where we will provide entertainment for children, sight seeing, museum and heritage tours. The SO track is limited, but free to attend and SO’s can stay at the conference accommodation at no extra cost as each ticket comes with a double room as standard. 

If you would like to arrive before the conference or stay on afterwards for a holiday in Ireland, then please make contact and we would be delighted to help you to plan a holiday. 

Le Grá
The NódeConf.eu team
