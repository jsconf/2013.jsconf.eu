Our friends from CSSconf.eu have published an <a href="http://2013.cssconf.eu/2013/08/27/things-to-do-in-berlin.html">excellent guide for things to do while you're in Berlin</a>. It applies equally well for JSConf, of course :)

In case you're looking for something to do on the Friday before JSConf â€“ <a href="https://tito.io/cssconfeu/cssconf-eu">CSSconf still has a few tickets available</a>.
