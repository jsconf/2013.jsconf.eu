JSConf EU is all about the community and we don’t stop at the festivities. Like in all previous years, we have a bunch of parties and a brunch prepared to celebrate this year’s JSConf EU, CSSConf EU, Reject.js & NodeCopter.

We want to make sure the whole Berlin developer scene (that is *you*!), not just the event’s attendees get to hang out with all the great people that make their way to Berlin this week.

So, as usual, our Parties and Relax.js are open for all!

In detail:

## [Reject.JS After Party](http://rejectjs.org/#afterparty), Thursday, September 12th,19:30

Tarantino's Bar | Brunnenstraße 163 | 10119 Berlin | [Map](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=Tarantino's+Bar&data=!4m10!1m9!4m8!1m3!1d4133!2d13.385135!3d52.533571!3m2!1i1278!2i1308!4f13.1)

Free for all, drinks are on you, if you don’t have a Reject.js badge.

The next three ones are included for all JSConf EU attendees, but everyone else is invited. The parties are all-inclusive and we need to ask you to [register for a ticket](https://tito.io/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-2013?release_id=ua2fijypje). It’s just 12€ incl. VAT for all parties (single party tickets aren’t available as they wouldn’t be any cheaper :).

Bring your friends!
