We're super happy to announce that <a href="http://www.franksentus.com/">FRANK SENT US</a> will play a live audio-visual extravaganza at our Saturday party. Put your dancing shoes on! This is what they say about themselves:

<blockquote>FSU is a sound and visual orgy for the soul. A clever pastiche that translates energy when seen live. They create a live audio video mash-up through real time mix of both media. The video is cut up and played like a musical instrument supported by the rock sounds of live guitar and bass.</blockquote>
