<b>Update: <a href="/news/2013/08/26/cssconf-combo-ticket.html">Last chance to get a ticket here.</a></b>

After planning the table and chair layout for this year we realized we could fit a few more people – so we decided to <a href="https://tito.io/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-2013">sell</a> a very limited number of additional tickets.

The price will be <strong>(€699 + VAT + Fee) = €849</strong>, which means you'll pay a <a href="http://jsbin.com/awixot/1/quiet" target="_blank">slightly higher percentage of the actual cost</a> compared to the regular sale.

The sale starts Wednesday, Aug 14 18:00 CEST – that is 9am Pacific.

Tickets will be sold through <a href="https://tito.io/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-2013">Tito</a> and again Paypal will be the only payment option (yes, we're still painfully sorry about that).

We've also started releasing info <a href="/speakers/">about the 2013 speakers</a> and will continue to do so in the coming days!
