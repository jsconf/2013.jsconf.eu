Mozilla has been a pioneer and advocate for the Web for more than a decade. We create and promote open standards that enable innovation and advance the Web as a platform for all. Today, hundreds of millions of people worldwide use Mozilla Firefox to experience the Web on computers, tablets and mobile devices. With Firefox OS and Firefox Marketplace, Mozilla is driving a new mobile ecosystem that is built entirely on open Web standards, freeing mobile providers, developers and end users from the limitations and restrictions imposed by proprietary platforms.
