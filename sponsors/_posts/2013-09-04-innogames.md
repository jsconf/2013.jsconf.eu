InnoGames, based in Hamburg, is one of the leading developers and publishers of online games with more than 100 million registered players around the world. We have been characterized by dynamic growth ever since the company was founded in 2007.

The JSConf offers InnoGames as a specialist for browser games the option to discuss and exchange ideas and information about the latest technological trends in the JS environment. We would like to share our experiences gained in the development of games as well as learning about new application areas for JavaScript and look forward to a lively interaction with the JavaScript Community.
