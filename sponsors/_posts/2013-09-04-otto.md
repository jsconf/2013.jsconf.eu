At Otto we strive for excellence. Becoming the best in eCommerce requires us to become the best in technology and development too.

So why did we decide to become a sponsor of the JSConf, as one of the best JavaScript conferences around? We hope to learn a lot and to get inspiration. If you are in Hamburg, drop by for a coffee and a raspberry pi.
